Hi, and welcome to my repository! 👽
I used this project to hone my skills and practice with reduxToolkit/React/typeScript and other little more stuff. In the future, I plan to redefine how to work with styles. I'll try to use some kind of preprocessor and give it a good makeover. But at this stage I'm happy with this set of solutions. The project is fully functional, you can even play with the bot. Isn't it cool? If you have any comments and suggestions, I will be glad to hear your opinion.🧐
